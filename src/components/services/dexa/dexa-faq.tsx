        question: 'What is a DEXA scan and how does it work?', 
        answer: 'A DEXA (Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry) scan uses two different X-ray beams to measure bone density. It\'s the most accurate way to assess bone health and detect osteoporosis. The scan measures how much X-ray energy is absorbed by your bones, providing precise density measurements.' 
    },
    { 
        question: 'How long does a DEXA scan take?', 
        answer: 'A DEXA scan typically takes 10-20 minutes, depending on the areas being scanned. The actual scanning time is usually just a few minutes, but preparation and positioning may take additional time.' 
    },
    { 
        question: 'Do I need to prepare for my DEXA scan?', 
        answer: 'Preparation is minimal. Avoid calcium supplements for 24 hours before the scan, wear comfortable clothing without metal, and remove jewelry. You may be asked to change into a hospital gown.' 
    },
    { 
        question: 'Is a DEXA scan safe?', 
        answer: 'Yes, DEXA scans are very safe and use extremely low doses of radiation - much lower than a regular X-ray. The radiation exposure is minimal and the benefits of early osteoporosis detection far outweigh any risks.' 
    },
    { 
        question: 'Will I feel anything during the DEXA scan?', 
        answer: 'DEXA scans are completely painless. You\'ll lie comfortably on a table while the scanner arm moves slowly over your body. You won\'t feel any radiation or discomfort.' 
    },
    { 
        question: 'When will I get my DEXA scan results?', 
        answer: 'Results are typically available within 24 hours and will be sent to your referring doctor. You can also access your results online through our patient portal.' 
    },
    { 
        question: 'Can I drive after my DEXA scan?', 
        answer: 'Yes, you can drive immediately after a DEXA scan. There are no restrictions on your activities after the procedure.' 
    },
    { 
        question: 'What should I wear for my DEXA scan?', 
        answer: 'Wear comfortable, loose-fitting clothing without metal zippers, buttons, or jewelry. You may be asked to change into a hospital gown for the scan.'
